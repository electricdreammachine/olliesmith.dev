hero_subtitle: >-
  I've been a software developer for a decade, so I've seen some stuff: huge paradigm shifts, a fair bit of tech industry roguery, and a glimpse of how much our society depends on code that was written around the time I saw Toy Story 2 for my 11th birthday. And whatever Google Glass was.


  Point is, I have experience (and no one has a Google Glass).
