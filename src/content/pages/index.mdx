  With a decade in software, I've had the opportunity to work on many projects in all manner of languages and frameworks as the industry has evolved. The constant has always been a drive to build software that helps people get things done; learning who they are and what they need, and then building the tools that help them do it. 


  I get animated about efficient development practices, well-crafted code, and emergent tech too, but my passion is in how it ultimately benefits people.
