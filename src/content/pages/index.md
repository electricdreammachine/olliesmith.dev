  The tech industry sometimes feel like a fever dream we're all having; everything is heightened, things morph into other things suddenly and with no real explanation, and some of the characters aren't quite lifelike.


  I've clung to the human side of it like a drowning man to driftwood, and found my happy place there - building things that matter, in the company of people who care.
