One of my more formative career experiences, this role was all about scale; I got to work on a bigger platform than ever before, with more people across more teams. The stakes felt higher than I'd known before - I was building software (Bankline) that people relied on directly to carry out their jobs on a daily basis.

I championed accessibility within that platform, liaising with a third party agency to audit and remedy areas of concern. I found this dimension to be some of the most interesting work with how much it broadened my horizons, beyond just the technical detail.

It also afforded me a chance to wade in and work on Java micro-services, which exposed me to design patterns and standards beyond the client application ones I was familiar with.

By the end of my tenure with the group, I was in a senior position contibuting to technical design across the platform, with personal accountability for particular areas.
