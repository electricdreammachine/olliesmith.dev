This role was a truly formative experience for my career. It involved working on a much larger platform than ever before, collaborating with a wider range of people across multiple teams. The stakes were higher â€“ I was building software (Bankline) that people relied on daily to perform their jobs. This instilled a real sense of responsibility  and the importance of the work.

I championed accessibility within the platform, working with a third-party agency to identify and address any usability concerns. This aspect of the role proved to be incredibly enriching, expanding my perspective beyond the purely technical aspects.

Additionally, I had the opportunity to dive into Java micro-services, exposing me to design patterns and standards far exceeding the client-side experience I was generally familiar with.

By the end of my time there, I had progressed to a senior position, contributing to the platform's technical design with ownership of nominated areas.
