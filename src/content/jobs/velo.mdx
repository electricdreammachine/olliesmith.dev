The variety in this role has been incredible, a perfect fit for someone who thrives on keeping things fresh. I've juggled maintaining UIs for live services built with everything from create-react-app to Next.js, and most recently, I've dived headfirst into exploring Remix.

The role also offered a chance to be involved in launching two Open Banking apps on mobile platforms. This presented a valuable opportunity to expand my skillset into mobile development, including both native Swift and cross-platform React Native.
