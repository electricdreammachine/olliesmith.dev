import Typography from "../../components/typography/typography";

This role has been varied in a way few roles are, which suits me brilliantly; alongside maintaining the UI of some live services, varied in structure from flavours of create-react-app to NextJS, and recently a foray into Remix SPA mode.

Additionally, I've had the opportunity to work to bring 2 Open Banking platforms to market. This has afforded me the chance to skill up in mobile development, both native (Swift) and cross-platform (React Native).
