This role offered a refreshing change of pace â€“ the chance to step outside the fintech world and build solutions for some of London's most prestigious commercial properties. It involved complex visitor and delivery management systems, and a custom content management platform that empowered clients to manage companion mobile apps.

The role also demanded full-stack skills. I delivered specific functionalities through serverless functions, utilizing AWS's Serverless Application Model for seamless deployment with all the necessary infrastructure in place.
