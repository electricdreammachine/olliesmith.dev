This role offered a unique opportunity to work on a SaaS platform that facilitated the smooth operation of real-world brick-and-mortar commercial real estate. I implemented complex visitor and delivery management systems in a white-labeled portal, as well as a bespoke content management platform that allowed clients to launch and manage mobile apps for their premises.

In addition to refining the portal UI, I worked in a full-stack capacity, delivering functionalities through serverless functions and utilizing AWS's Serverless Application Model to orchestrate CloudFormation deployments with all necessary infrastructure.
