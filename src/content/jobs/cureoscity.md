I had the opportunity in this role to step outside of my fintech niche and deliver building management solutions which serviced some of the most prominent commercial properties in London. This included complex delivery and visitor management, as well as a custom content management platform which allowed customers to flesh out a companion mobile app.

Elements of this role were full stack, including delivering certain functionality via serverless functions, orchestrated via AWS's Serverless Application Model to seamlessly deploy functions with all of their requisite infrastructure.
