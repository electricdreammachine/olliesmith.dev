  The tech industry is a shared fever dream we're all having, where crazy things unfold amidst a cast of characters so lifelike they almost seem real.


  Fortunately, while it's all kind of a dream, I'm from the streets and I always keep it real. Stick with me, kid.


  Unfortunately, I'm also a very experienced developer.
