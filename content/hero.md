  The software industry is a shared fever dream we're all having in which meetings are called 'ceremonies',
  and we've convinced ourselves that we're practitioners of the most prestigious and arcane form of typing.


  I think that's all a bit silly - meetings are meetings, and calling people who type for a living 'rockstars' is pretty cringe.


  Unfortunately, I'm also a very experienced developer.
