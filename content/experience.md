      - visiting client sites to understand how they used the platform in practice

      For a number of years, I worked as part of a community of engineers - on different teams at different times - to build and maintain a commercial banking platform (Bankline); this role was formative for me as a developer.

      - participated in an Accessibility Community of Practice to gain a deeper understanding of accessibility concerns and how to address them, both in technical implementation and in furthering the agenda
      - diagnosed and resolved a number of production incidents, including a platform outage
      - implemented functionality to allow the bank to meet regulatory obligations (PSD2, SCA, Deposit Guarantees)
